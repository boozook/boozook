## About

System developer from Earth, made in 1985.

Creating software & games since 2000 and having fun as a software engineer, consultant, game developer & reverse-engineering enthusiast.
<abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> enthusiast. Fanatic of optimization of any processes.


Previously I've made various systems, software as well as games using following languages: Rust, Haxe, Python, ObjC++, Swift and Solidity, but these are just instruments - my job is a work on logic, algorithms, graphics and data using any languages.

During past years I was mostly writing decentralized systems mostly in Rust _(yet before the first version 🦀)_.

As a hobby I'm creating cross-platform remakes of great wonderful old games.

I love my [family][], [LLVM][], inline skating 🛼, bowling 🎳, carting 🏎, table tennis 🏓, chess ♟, emoji 🤔, tons of ice cream 🍨, robots 🤖, books 📚, macintosh , demoscene, shaders, wisdom and clear usability.
